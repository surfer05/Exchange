There is a slight problem in the repo. Actually , while creating Next app , a git module was 
automatically initialized for the swap folder, thus while pushing code to github , the swap folder 
was added as submodule and not as a code folder . Thus , you won't be able to see the code of the 
swap folder. I have a created a different repository for the same folder named "Exchange-Swap".
Please do look into it for the code. Thank you.
